## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Patrick Jiacheng Shen from NYU class of 2025
-  I'm generally interested in the following fields:
    - Causal ML and its applications in graph, NLP, and RL 
    - Recommendation Systems
    - Reinforcement Learning and its applications in Mean Field Type Games, Recommendation Systems, and Causality.
    - ML for cognitive science(used to, but now have less passion after I participated one EEG project in Abu Dhabi and NYU's DG-GA 1013 Computational Cognitive Modelling class)
-  I wouldn't say I like computer vision and LLMs.
-  I want to do one more RL for recommendation system project before I graduate.

## I live in Wanzhou, Chongqing City, a mountainous city famous for its grilled fish and noodles.
- I love playing basketball in the street court by the Yangtze River during sunset
- I love driving on the Bay Road in Wanzhou, Chongqing City.
- I love washing feet.
