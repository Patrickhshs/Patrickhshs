## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Patrick Jiacheng Shen from NYU class of 2025
-  I'm generally interested in the following fields:
    - Causal ML and its applications in graph, NLP, and RL 
    - Recommendation Systems
    - Reinforcement Learning and its applications in Mean Field Type Games, Recommendation Systems, and Causality.
    - ML for cognitive science(not interested anymore after I participated one EEG project in Abu Dhabi and NYU's DG-GA 1013 Computational Cognitive Modelling class)
-  I wouldn't say I like computer vision and LLMs.
-  I want to do one more RL with recommendation system project before I graduate.
